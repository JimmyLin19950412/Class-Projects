; *	This program uses TIMER 0 to contol the sound from the speaker.
; *	Using a timer allows more precise control of the pitch than a delay loop.
; *	TIMER 0 is set up as a 16-bit timer (input clock frequency is (7.373 MHz/2).
; *	The timer increments once for each cycle of the input clock.  When the 
; *	timer rolls over from all '1's to all '0's, it is set to cause an interrupt.
; *	This requires the program to have an interrupt service routine(ISR), which
; *	executes when the interrupt occurs.  The ISR in this program complements
; *	P0.2, which will produce the sound in the speaker.  It also loads a value into
; *	TIMER 0.  By loading different values into TIMER 0, the programmer can control 
; *	how long it takes until the timer increments to all '1's.  If you put a small
; *	value into the timer it will take longer to increment up to all '1's than if
; *	put a larger value into the timer.
; *	This code was written by a student in one of the summer camps and I placed
; *	it on the website as an example of how to use one of the P89LPC925 peripherals
; *	and how to use interrupts (See "How interrupts work" at the end of this code).
; *	For more information on all of the peripherals in this microprocessor please
; *	see the User Manual and Data sheet for the P89LPC925.  Links are given
; *	on the website.
; *	This program also shows how subroutines can be used to simplfy the code.

; * Note Subroutines

; * The value in R0 sets the duration the note is played.  It determines
; * the number of times the processor loops in the stall subroutine
; *
; * The values in R3 and R4 are the upper and lower bytes of the 16-bit
; * re-load value for TIMER 0.  They set the pitch of the note.  The smaller the
; * number, the lower the pitch and the larger the number, the higher the pitch.

; * 	How interrupts work:
; *	
; *	For an interrupt to occur from a peripheral, the interrupt must be enabled
; *	in the peripheral control registers and the global interrupt enable bit must
; *	be set.  When the peripheral reaches a condition that causes an interrupt, it
; *	sets a flag (a bit in a control register).  Since interrupts are enabled, this
; *	this flag is sent to the processor core where it requests an interrupt.
; *	When the processor completes the current instruction, it saves its current
; *	program location and jumps to appropriate location in the interrupt vector
; *	table (0x000B for TIMER 0 overflow)to begin executing the interrupt service
; *	routine.  The main item the ISR must do is clear the condition that is causing
; *	the interrupt to occur.  For the TIMER 0 overflow, just responding to the
; *	interrupt clears the overflow flag.  Other actions can be performed in the ISR,
; *	but they should not take a long time.  A properly written ISR will also save and 
; *	restore any registers that are used, so they are not changed from what was being
; *	used by the main program.  The last instruction in the ISR is the return from
; *	interrupt instruction (reti).  This tells the processor to return to its 
; *	previously saved location to exectute the next instruction.
